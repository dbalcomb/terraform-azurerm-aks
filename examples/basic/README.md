# Example: Basic

This example creates an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with a single
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) user.

## Notes

- The user principal name of the administrator is in the format for a Microsoft
  Account with access to Azure Active Directory (AAD). In most scenarios, such
  as with an Office 365 account, the user principal name will be the email
  address of the user.
